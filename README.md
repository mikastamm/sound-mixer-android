## What is this?
Sound Mixer for Android brings the functionality of the Windows Sound Mixer to Android. It lets remotely control the Volume of each Application running on your computer. I needed to be able to do this but couldnt find an app that does that already, so I decided to do it myself.

This repository contains the source for the Android application. The Windows-Application you have to install on your computer to remote control it can be found here: https://github.com/mikastamm/sound-mixer-server
